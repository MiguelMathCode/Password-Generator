# Password-Generator
This is my very first GUI. I used Python as programming language and Tkinter library to create the GUI. The idea is to manage passwords for each account that one person can have i.e. email, github, etc. I wanted a very organic password, not a password generated by other application like a browser or Google.

# Note 
If you want to try out the app you have to create a SQLite3 database for your own testing.
